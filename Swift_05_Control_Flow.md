# Control Flow
## 1. For-In Loop
* this is for iterate over a sequence such as items in array, ranges of numbers, characters in a string etc.
```swift
let names = ["Anna", "Alex", "Brian", "Jack"]
for name in names {
    print("Hello, \(name)!")
}
// Hello, Anna!
// Hello, Alex!
// Hello, Brian!
// Hello, Jack!

``` 
* iteration over dictionary with key-value pairs
  * iteration does not guarantee thw order as dictionary is inherently unordered
```swift
let numberOfLegs = ["spider": 8, "ant": 6, "cat": 4]
for (animalName, legCount) in numberOfLegs {
    print("\(animalName)s have \(legCount) legs")
}
// cats have 4 legs
// ants have 6 legs
// spiders have 8 legs
```
* iteration over numeric ranges
```swift
for index in 1...5 {
    print("\(index) times 5 is \(index * 5)")
}
// 1 times 5 is 5
// 2 times 5 is 10
// 3 times 5 is 15
// 4 times 5 is 20
// 5 times 5 is 25
```
* If you don’t need each value from a sequence, you can ignore the values by using an underscore(`_`) in place of a variable name.
```swift
let base = 3
let power = 10
var answer = 1
for _ in 1...power {
    answer *= base
}
print("\(base) to the power of \(power) is \(answer)")
// Prints "3 to the power of 10 is 59049"
```
* `stride(from:to:by)` and closed ranges
```swift
let minutes = 60
for tickMark in 0..<minutes {
    // render the tick mark each minute (60 times)
}

let minuteInterval = 5
for tickMark in stride(from: 0, to: minutes, by: minuteInterval) {
    // render the tick mark every 5 minutes (0, 5, 10, 15 ... 45, 50, 55)
}

let hours = 12
let hourInterval = 3
for tickMark in stride(from: 3, through: hours, by: hourInterval) {
    // render the tick mark every 3 hours (3, 6, 9, 12)
}
```

## 2. While Loops
1. `while` : starts by evaluate a single condition
* *snakes and ladders*
```swift
let finalSquare = 25
var board = [Int](repeating: 0, count: finalSquare + 1)
//ladders
board[03] = +08; board[06] = +11; board[09] = +09; board[10] = +02
//snakes
board[14] = -10; board[19] = -11; board[22] = -02; board[24] = -08

var square = 0
var diceRoll = 0
while square < finalSquare {
    // roll the dice
    diceRoll += 1
    if diceRoll == 7 { diceRoll = 1 }
    // move by the rolled amount
    square += diceRoll
    if square < board.count {
        // if we're still on the board, move up or down for a snake or a ladder
        square += board[square]
    }
}
print("Game over!")
```
2. `repeat-while`
```swift
let finalSquare = 25
var board = [Int](repeating: 0, count: finalSquare + 1)
board[03] = +08; board[06] = +11; board[09] = +09; board[10] = +02
board[14] = -10; board[19] = -11; board[22] = -02; board[24] = -08
var square = 0
var diceRoll = 0

repeat {
    // move up or down for a snake or ladder
    square += board[square]
    // roll the dice
    diceRoll += 1
    if diceRoll == 7 { diceRoll = 1 }
    // move by the rolled amount
    square += diceRoll
} while square < finalSquare
print("Game over!")
```

## 3. Conditional Statements
### 1. if
* check whether the statement is true or false
```swift
var temperatureInFahrenheit = 30
if temperatureInFahrenheit <= 32 {
    print("It's very cold. Consider wearing a scarf.")
}
// Prints "It's very cold. Consider wearing a scarf."
```
* else is executed when if statement is false
```swift
temperatureInFahrenheit = 40
if temperatureInFahrenheit <= 32 {
    print("It's very cold. Consider wearing a scarf.")
} else {
    print("It's not that cold. Wear a t-shirt.")
}
// Prints "It's not that cold. Wear a t-shirt."
```
* chained if statements
```swift
temperatureInFahrenheit = 90
if temperatureInFahrenheit <= 32 {
    print("It's very cold. Consider wearing a scarf.")
} else if temperatureInFahrenheit >= 86 {
    print("It's really warm. Don't forget to wear sunscreen.")
} else {
    print("It's not that cold. Wear a t-shirt.")
}
// Prints "It's really warm. Don't forget to wear sunscreen."
```
* `if - else if - else if - else if - ... - else` is exhaustive : every possible value of the type being considered must be matched one of the sections
```swift
temperatureInFahrenheit = 72
if temperatureInFahrenheit <= 32 {
    print("It's very cold. Consider wearing a scarf.")
} else if temperatureInFahrenheit >= 86 {
    print("It's really warm. Don't forget to wear sunscreen.")
}
```
### 2. switch
* exhaustive : every possible value of the type being considered must be matched by one of the switch cases
* break is not required in  Swift
```swift
let someCharacter: Character = "z"
switch someCharacter {
case "a":
    print("The first letter of the alphabet")
case "z":
    print("The last letter of the alphabet")
default:
    print("Some other character")
}
// Prints "The last letter of the alphabet"
```
* can combine two cases
```swift
let anotherCharacter: Character = "a"
switch anotherCharacter {
case "a", "A":
    print("The letter A")
default:
    print("Not the letter A")
}
// Prints "The letter A"
```
* matching intervals
```swift
let approximateCount = 62
let countedThings = "moons orbiting Saturn"
let naturalCount: String
switch approximateCount {
case 0:
    naturalCount = "no"
case 1..<5:
    naturalCount = "a few"
case 5..<12:
    naturalCount = "several"
case 12..<100:
    naturalCount = "dozens of"
case 100..<1000:
    naturalCount = "hundreds of"
default:
    naturalCount = "many"
}
print("There are \(naturalCount) \(countedThings).")
// Prints "There are dozens of moons orbiting Saturn."
```
* matching tuples
```swift
let somePoint = (1, 1)
switch somePoint {
case (0, 0):
    print("\(somePoint) is at the origin")
case (_, 0):
    print("\(somePoint) is on the x-axis")
case (0, _):
    print("\(somePoint) is on the y-axis")
case (-2...2, -2...2):
    print("\(somePoint) is inside the box")
default:
    print("\(somePoint) is outside of the box")
}
// Prints "(1, 1) is inside the box"
```
* value binding
```swift
let anotherPoint = (2, 0)
switch anotherPoint {
case (let x, 0):
    print("on the x-axis with an x value of \(x)")
case (0, let y):
    print("on the y-axis with a y value of \(y)")
case let (x, y):
    print("somewhere else at (\(x), \(y))")
}
// Prints "on the x-axis with an x value of 2"
```
* `where` : to check additional condition
```swift
let yetAnotherPoint = (1, -1)
switch yetAnotherPoint {
case let (x, y) where x == y:
    print("(\(x), \(y)) is on the line x == y")
case let (x, y) where x == -y:
    print("(\(x), \(y)) is on the line x == -y")
case let (x, y):
    print("(\(x), \(y)) is just some arbitrary point")
}
// Prints "(1, -1) is on the line x == -y"
```
* compound cases
```swift
let someCharacter: Character = "e"
switch someCharacter {
case "a", "e", "i", "o", "u":
    print("\(someCharacter) is a vowel")
case "b", "c", "d", "f", "g", "h", "j", "k", "l", "m",
     "n", "p", "q", "r", "s", "t", "v", "w", "x", "y", "z":
    print("\(someCharacter) is a consonant")
default:
    print("\(someCharacter) isn't a vowel or a consonant")
}
// Prints "e is a vowel"
```
* compound cases with value binding
```swift
let stillAnotherPoint = (9, 0)
switch stillAnotherPoint {
case (let distance, 0), (0, let distance):
    print("On an axis, \(distance) from the origin")
default:
    print("Not on an axis")
}
// Prints "On an axis, 9 from the origin"
```
## 4. Control Transfer Statements
* `Continue` : 
  * “I am done with the current loop iteration”
  * tells a loop to stop what it is doing and start at the begining of the next iteration
```swift
let puzzleInput = "great minds think alike"
var puzzleOutput = ""
let charactersToRemove: [Character] = ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u", " "]
for character in puzzleInput {
    if charactersToRemove.contains(character) {
        continue
    }
    puzzleOutput.append(character)
}
print(puzzleOutput)
// Prints "grtmndsthnklk"
```
* `Break`
  * ends execution of an entire control flow statement immediately
  * transfers control to the code after the loop's closing brace
  * breaks switch 
  ```swift
  let numberSymbol: Character = "三"  // Chinese symbol for the number 3
  var possibleIntegerValue: Int?
  switch numberSymbol {
  case "1", "١", "一", "๑":
    possibleIntegerValue = 1
  case "2", "٢", "二", "๒":
    possibleIntegerValue = 2
  case "3", "٣", "三", "๓":
    possibleIntegerValue = 3
  case "4", "٤", "四", "๔":
    possibleIntegerValue = 4
  default:
      break
  }
  if let integerValue = possibleIntegerValue {
    print("The integer value of \(numberSymbol) is \(integerValue).")
  } else {
      print("An integer value couldn't be found for \(numberSymbol).")
  }
  // Prints "The integer value of 三 is 3."
  ```
* `Fallthrough`
  * C-style switch w/o break at each case trial
  ```swift
  let integerToDescribe = 5
  var description = "The number \(integerToDescribe) is"
  switch integerToDescribe {
  case 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19:
      description += " a prime number, and also"
      fallthrough
  default:
      description += " an integer."
  }
  print(description)
  // Prints "The number 5 is a prime number, and also an integer."
  ```
* Labeled Statements  
  * form 
  ```swift
  label name: while condition {
    statements
  }
  ```
  * to distinguish certain loops from another
  * make it easier to utilise `break` and `continue` 
  * *Ladders and Snakes*
  ```swift
  let finalSquare = 25
  var board = [Int](repeating: 0, count: finalSquare + 1)
  board[03] = +08; board[06] = +11; board[09] = +09; board[10] = +02
  board[14] = -10; board[19] = -11; board[22] = -02; board[24] = -08
  var square = 0
  var diceRoll = 0

  gameLoop: while square != finalSquare {
    diceRoll += 1
    if diceRoll == 7 { diceRoll = 1 }
    switch square + diceRoll {
    case finalSquare:
        // diceRoll will move us to the final square, so the game is over
        break gameLoop
    case let newSquare where newSquare > finalSquare:
        // diceRoll will move us beyond the final square, so roll again
        continue gameLoop
    default:
        // this is a valid move, so find out its effect
        square += diceRoll
        square += board[square]
    }
  }
  print("Game over!")
  ```

## 5. Early Exit
* `guard` 
  * code shall be executed if and only if the condition in the `guard` statement is true
  * a `guard` must have its corresponding `else`
  * any var or constant that were assigned value using an optional binding as part of the condition are available for the rest of the code block 
  * else must transfer control to exit the code block
```swift
func greet(person: [String: String]) {
    guard let name = person["name"] else {
        return
    }

    print("Hello \(name)!")

    guard let location = person["location"] else {
        print("I hope the weather is nice near you.")
        return
    }

    print("I hope the weather is nice in \(location).")
}

greet(person: ["name": "John"])
// Prints "Hello John!"
// Prints "I hope the weather is nice near you."
greet(person: ["name": "Jane", "location": "Cupertino"])
// Prints "Hello Jane!"
// Prints "I hope the weather is nice in Cupertino."
```

## 6. Checking API Availability
* Swift has built-in support for checking API availability : protected from using unavailable APIs
* form
```swift
if #available(platformName version, ..., *) {
    statements to execute if the APIs are available
} else {
    fallback statements to execute if the APIs are unavailable
}
```
* The compiler uses availability information in the SDK to verify that all of the APIs used in your code are available on the deployment target specified by your project. Swift reports an error at compile time if you try to use an API that isn’t available.
* use `if` or `guard` statement
* availability check w.r.t iOS and macOS 
```swift
if #available(iOS 10, macOS 10.12, *) {
    // Use iOS 10 APIs on iOS, and use macOS 10.12 APIs on macOS
} else {
    // Fall back to earlier iOS and macOS APIs
}
```
