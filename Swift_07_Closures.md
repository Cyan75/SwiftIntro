# Closures
> * closures are self-contained blocks of functionality that can be passed around and used in the code
> * siliar to lambdas in other programming languages
> * can capture and store references to any constants and vaiables from the context in which they are defined
> * Three forms of closures
>    * Global functions : have a name, do not capture any values
>    * Nested functions : have name, can capture values from their enclosing functions
>    * Closure expressions : no name, in a lightweight syntax that can capture values from surrounding contex
>  * Swift Closure features
>     * Inferring parameter and return value types from context
>     * Implicit returns from single-expression closures
>     * Shorthand argument names
>     * Trailing closure syntax
