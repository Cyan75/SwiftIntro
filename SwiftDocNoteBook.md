### Overview
* Adopting Modern Programming Patterns
  * Variables are always initialised before use
  * Array indices are checked for out-of-bounds errors
  * Integers are checked for overflow
  * Optionals ensure that `nil` values are handled explicitly
  * Memotry is managed automatically
  * Error handling allows controlled recovery from unexpected failures
